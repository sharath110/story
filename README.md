Overview of the Node Management Auto Script

This script is designed to simplify node management for the Story Protocol by providing a user-friendly, interactive interface. Users can perform a variety of tasks with minimal manual input, allowing for easy maintenance and operation of a Story Protocol node.

Key Features:
Dependency Management: Automatically install and configure all necessary dependencies for the node.

Binary Setup: Easily manage node binaries, including installation, updates, and ensuring the node operates on the correct versions.

Node Operations: Perform essential node operations such as starting, stopping, refreshing, and monitoring the node's status.

Validator Key Management: Generate, back up, and recover validator keys for enhanced security and ease of use.

Staking and Balances: Securely interact with the network to check balances and stake tokens efficiently.

Backup and Recovery: Back up and restore important node data to safeguard against data loss.

The script is interactive, waiting for user input to select and perform the desired operation. It’s accessible to both beginners and experienced users, automating key tasks and reducing the complexity of node management.

Code Breakdown of the Menu Function
1. node_management_menu()
This is the primary function that presents a menu to the user.
It offers 17 different options to manage the Story Protocol node.
The menu includes tasks like "Install Dependencies," "Story-Geth Binary Setup," "Node Status," and more.
Once a user selects an option, the script validates the input and calls the corresponding function to execute the desired task.
2.  Menu Options Overview

Each menu option is mapped to a function that handles specific node management tasks. Here’s a brief explanation of the main options:

1. Install Dependencies: Automatically installs all necessary software packages and libraries required for node operation.

2. Story-Geth Binary Setup: Sets up the Story-Geth binary to enable Ethereum-compatible layer interaction.
3. Story Binary Setup: Configures the Story Protocol’s core binary for node functionality.
4. Setup Moniker Name: Allows the user to assign a unique name (moniker) to their node.
5. Update Peers: Updates the node’s peer list for better network synchronization.
6. Update Snapshot: Syncs the node using the latest available blockchain snapshot.
7. Stop Node: Safely shuts down the node’s processes.
8. Start Node: Starts the node and connects it to the network.
9. Refresh Node: Restarts the node to apply updates with minimal downtime.
10. Logs Checker: Displays the node’s logs for monitoring and debugging purposes.
11. Node Status: Shows the current status and health of the node.
12. Validator Info: Displays details about the node’s validator status.
13. Private Key Checker: Verifies and displays the node’s private key.
14. Balance Checker: Checks the token balance of the node.
15. Stake IP: Stakes tokens, allowing the node to participate in validator activities.
16. Full Backup: Backs up the node’s data and configuration files.
17. Recovery Backup: Restores the node from a previous backup.
3. Interactive Prompt
The script runs in a loop until the user chooses the "Exit" option (Option 17). For every user input, the script displays relevant information and executes the chosen function.

4. Error Handling
If an invalid option is selected, the script prompts the user to provide a valid number between 1 and 17, ensuring smooth operation.

Conclusion
This automatic script, developed by sharath110, is a comprehensive tool designed to simplify Story Protocol node management. With a clear and organized interface, it allows users to efficiently handle node operations and focus on higher-level tasks. Whether you are a newcomer or an experienced user, this script makes node management seamless and secure, ensuring your blockchain node runs smoothly.
